# Pixel Adblock Filters

This repository hosts my personal ad block filters. To be fair, it blocks more than ads, such as annoying things in my opinion. You can use it as-is, or look at the code and use the ones you like.

It is made for uBlock Origin, my daily driver for ad blocking, and uses advanced syntax of it, compared to something like Adblock Plus.
